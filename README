The codedoc plugin is directed at the display of large blocks of code.  Its basic syntax is:
<codedoc code> 
</codedoc>

<codedoc file> 
</codedoc>

<codedoc toggle description> 
</codedoc>

The first two create code blocks of the type specified by the parameter -- code or file.

The third creates an initially hidden code block which comes with a toggle button
enabling the block to be opened and closed (i.e.displayed and hidden).  The description,
which is a text string, describes the content of this block.

So, a more complete syntax model would be:
<codedoc code> 
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
</codedoc>

<codedoc file> 
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
</codedoc>

This nesting of the codedoc containers is limited to one level, that is you can't include a
toggle inside another toggle.

There are three forms that support comments. 
      ~~codedoc:timestamp~~
      ~~codedoc:comment~~             
      ~~codedoc:xref:anchor_name~~  

1. The first simply creates a timestamp for the file which contains the documented code:

2. The second allows for internal comments on the code. The comment can contain Dokuwiki
internal links, for instance:

   Dokuwiki embeds [[:snippet]] filenames in HTML definition lists [[:definitions#def_1|see definitions]]

As the above demonstrates, the links can contain references to internal link headings. Wherever
Dokiwiki creates a heading, it creates a named anchor. So this:

     ===== This is a Heading ===== 

creates the following anchor:

    <a name="this_is_a_heading" id="this_is_a_heading">This is a Heading</a>

If the comment contains a <br /> character or takes up more than one line, the comment
will have the coment characters on separate lines as in:

/*
  comment
**/

Otherwise the comment appears on one line:  /* comment */

3. The third creates named anchors which enable you to link to places on a page where there 
are no Dokuwiki headings:
     <a name="anchor_name">&nbsp;</a>
